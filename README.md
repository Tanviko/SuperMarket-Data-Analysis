# SuperMarket-Data-Analysis
Here market basket algorithm is used to find out the patterns and consumer behaviour in the dataset and hence understanding the trends for strategic development of the supermarket. 
 This code is used to find the association rules between the items in supermarket.
 The supermarket can use these rules to find the combination of items sold together. Have looked for first 5 major rules in the code.
 This can help them to plan strategically of increasing item sale or location of those items.
 Marketing team can think of giving discounts for example: giving berry discount in berry season is valid because we can see that berry is sold with yoghurt, milk as well as sour cream (This result can be found in code)
 This will help increase profit of the supermarket.
