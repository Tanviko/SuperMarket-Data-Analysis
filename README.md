# SuperMarket-Data-Analysis
I have used market basket algorithm to find out the trends in the dataset and hence understanding them for strategic development of the supermarket
This code is used to find the association rules between the items in supermarket.
The supermarket can use these rules to find the combination of items sale together
This can help them to plan strategically of increasing item sale or location of those items.
Marketing team can think of giving discounts for example: giving berry discount in berry season is valid because we can see that berry is sold with yoghurt,milk as well sour cream(This result can be found in code)
This will help increasing profit of the supermarket.
